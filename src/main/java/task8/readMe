    1.   Need to change interfaces file, from way: /etc/network/interfaces
    auto configuring:
          auto eth1
          allow-hotplug eth1
          iface eth1 inet dhcp

    2.As an alternative, you can run the following command line as user root which will
    stop automatically after 60 seconds.

     # mkdir –p /tmp/cd ; tcpdump -n -nn -N -s 0 -i eth1 -w /tmp/cd/eth1.pcap & pid=$! ; sleep 60 ; kill -1 $pid

    3. sudo tail -n 20 /var/log/messages

    4.The grep command which stands for “global regular expression print,” processes text
    line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. The grep command is
    used to search text or searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given
    strings or words. By default, grep displays the matching lines.

    5.The cat command allows us to create single or multiple files,
    view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.
