    1 How does the ping work
    2 If A can ping B and B can ping C, does it mean that A can ping C?
    3 Configure a switch interface to be access vlan 24.
    4 What is the difference between a router and a switch
    5 What is the difference between TCP and UDP
    6 What are the main usages of VLANs

**************************************************************************************

    1.The ping command first sends an echo request packet to an address, then waits for a reply.
      The ping is successful only if:
      the echo request gets to the destination, and the destination is able to get an echo reply
      back to the source within a predetermined time called a timeout.

    2.You are on host A. Using -R makes B listen on a port and forward to C.
      This might be fine, depending on how wide open your access to B is.
      Using -L makes A listen on a port, and tunnel the connection through B to C.
      So, let's say B is 10.10.10.10 and C is 20.20.20.20, and you want to connect to C via ssh.
      You run this command:

      ssh -L 8000:20.20.20.20:22 user@10.10.10.10

      Now A is listening on port 8000, but connections to it will be tunneled through to 20.20.20.20:22,
      so in a local shell, run this command:
      ssh user@127.0.0.1:8000

      This will make the connection to C (via your open session to B). Substitute other ports for other services,
      e.g. to connect to a webserver on C:

      ssh -L 8000:20.20.20.20:80 user@10.10.10.10

    3.To add ports to these VLANs, assign them as follows:

      sw# configure terminal
      sw(config)# interface FastEthernet 0/12
      sw(config-if)# switchport mode access
      sw(config-if)# switchport access vlan 24

    4.Just as a switch connects multiple devices to create a network, a router
      connects multiple switches, and their respective networks, to form an even larger network.

    5.TCP is a communications protocol, using which the data is transmitted between systems over the network.
      In this, the data is transmitted into the form of packets.
      It includes error-checking, guarantees the delivery and preserves the order of the data packets.
      UDP is same as the TCP protocol except this doesnâ€™t guarantee the error-checking and data recovery.
      If you use this protocol, the data will be sent continuously, irrespective of the issues in the receiving end.

    6.VLAN allows different computers and devices to be connected virtually to each other as if they were in a LAN
      sharing a single broadcast domain. In a way, a VLAN acts mini separate networks within a LAN. A VLAN is helpful
      for organizational use mainly because it can be used to segment a larger network into smaller segments. As shown
      in the figure below, different VLANs can be used for different groups of users, departments, functions, etc.
